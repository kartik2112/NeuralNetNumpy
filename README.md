# NeuralNetNumpy

This covers the implementation of neural network with regularisation. I have implemented the back propagation algorithm for Logistic Regression using NumPy. Here, I have used the original [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) by Yann LeCun and trained it with a simple (25,10) neural network to achieve an accuracy of 91.67 %.
