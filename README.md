# NeuralNetNumpy

This covers the implementation of neural network with regularisation. I have implemented the back propagation algorithm for Logistic Regression using NumPy. Here, I have used the original [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) by Yann LeCun and trained it with a (300,200,100) neural network to achieve an accuracy of 93.44 %.

Following optimisations were implemented:
* Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum
* Regularisation
* Learning Rate Annealing
